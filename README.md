# Expense Tracker

### Expense Tracker is a web application that allows users to track their income and expenses. Users can add, edit, and delete transactions, as well as view their balance and spending history. Expense Tracker uses React for the front-end, Node.js and Express for the back-end, and MongoDB for the database.

# Credits

### This project is inspired by React - The Complete Guide 2023 (incl. React Router & Redux) course by Academind by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller. I highly recommend checking out their course if you want to learn more about web development.
